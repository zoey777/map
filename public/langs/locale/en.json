		"text1": "Amidst the trend of digitization and virtulization, physical presence is no longer the exclusive notion of a city, and the very definition of a city is currently undergoing a profound evolution. Nowadays, the virtual world is becoming increasingly intertwined with the physical reality, allowing individuals to explore cities through the internet and digital technologies without the constraints of physical presence. For instance, online street view applications like Google Street View or Baidu Street View serve as effective tools for exploring city images worldwide.\n\nHowever, with the advancement of information infrastructure in smart cities, the desire for the exploration of city images has surged. This includes the rapid retrieval of specific streetscapes, intelligent interaction with urban environments, and informed decision-making for urban planning and development. But these online street view applications still remain constrained by a \"monotonous\" exploration mode, where users are limited to one-way clicks, navigating virtual streets without the opportunity for diverse and interactive urban experiences.\n\nHence, we have introduced an \"Urban Streetscape Search Engine\" application, which systematically collects, analyzes, and characterize the visual information stream of the city streetscapes. Aiming to achieve a dynamic, multi-dimensional, and efficient exploration of urban streetscapes, ultimately revolutionizing the methods of managing and exploring modern urban images.\n",
		"text2": "In this \"Urban Streetscape Search Engine\", we specifically focus on three categories of visual representation of street scenes: physical representation, impression representation, and isovist representation.",
		"text3": "Physical representation focus on tangible, recognizable elements within the streetscape, such as buildings, vegetation, street furniture, and other physical components.",
		"text4": "Impression representation, on the other hand, captures the more abstract qualities of the streetscape, focusing on the overall atmosphere and mood conveyed by elements such as texture, patterns, and colors. This sensory dimension enriches the search engine’s capacity by integrating the emotional or perceptual responses that different urban scenes evoke.",
		"text5": "Finally, the isovist representation pertains to spatial analysis, examining the geometric properties of a given viewpoint. This includes factors such as the area visible from a particular location, the perimeter of the visible space, compactness, and the level of enclosure or openness. These spatial characteristics are crucial for understanding how people perceive and navigate urban spaces, as they influence feelings of comfort, safety, and accessibility.",

Furthermore, Click on the left-side \"Find geo-location\" to explore where these streetscapes are positioned on the left \"geo-map\". This action can be useful in different situations, like seeking locations with vibrant color combinations for urban color planners or art painters, choosing visually simple routes for city navigation, and more.\n· Based on your preferences and ideas, handpick streetscapes within the \"feature map\", then click \"Find geo-location\" to uncover how these chosen streetscapes are distributed on the \"geo-map\". This action can be useful in identifying high-density urban areas for urban heat studies, or assisting tourists in discovering natural scenic spots within the city.",
